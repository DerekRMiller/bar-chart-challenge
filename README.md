# Bar Chart Challenge (v1.1.1)

![screenshot](./src/shared/images/screenshot.png)

This project was inspired by a challenge I read from a post stating one simple instruction: build a bar chart and feed it data from this endpoint: <https://www.random.org/integers/?num=200&min=1&max=10&col=1&base=10&format=plain&rnd=new>.

Other notes:

- Additional criteria I added was it had to built from scratch (no UI libraries).

- Started to explore animation transitions between the different states.
